#+TITLE: CPP implementation Notes

- Using ~std::array~ for collections
  whose length is known at compile time
- Using ~std::vector~ for collections
  whose length is unkown at compile time

* Size vs Coordinate
Sizes and coordinates are semantically different
but are at the moment represented by ~std::array<int,Dimension>~
anyway.
